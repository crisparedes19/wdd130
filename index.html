            <p>Well, let me tell you a little bit about my city. Tarija is a place located in the south part of Bolivia, and borders Argentina. Well known for 
                being the "city of the smile", called in that way because their inhabitants are always receiving people the best way and also 
                for always being kind with everyone, even when we do not know each other.
